# Bugs
## plan
* ~~bugged1~~ (`omp for` not close to `for`)
* ~~bugged2~~ (use `reduction`)
* ~~bugged3~~ ? (code format & refactoring, but there are no any runtime errors, for `c++98` too)
* ~~bugged4~~ (stack overflow)
* ~~bugged5~~ (localize locks)
* ~~bugged6~~ (shared var must be in global scope)

**All is done!**
